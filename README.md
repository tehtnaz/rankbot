# rankbot

A basic leveling bot for Discord created by @tehtnaz

## How to use
- You can assign roles for different XP levels
- A level 0 role represents a join role (a role which is automatically assignment upon joining)
- You may display the top 5 users using /leaderboard
- /rank shows the XP and level of somebody
- Other commands have descriptions written in the slash command. They are pretty simple though.

## Suggested features for v0.4.0 which never got implemented
- [ ] more xp for server booster(1) (multiplier)
- [ ] /role adds a role to someone
- [ ] add ability to disable certain channels from making you gain levels


(1) if you cannot detect if they’re boosting server, use particular role for assigning (AKA make it a global feature that you can make certain roles multiply XP
this can be enabled/disabled using similar settings system to soundbot
